# Objectives

* Define what recursion is and how it can be used

* Understand the two essential components of a recursive function

* Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
* Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems

### What is recursion?
* A **process** (a function in our case) that calls itself

### Examples of where you have worked with recursion
* JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
* document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
* Object traversal
* We will see it with more complex data structures
* It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration
