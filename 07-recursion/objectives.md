# Objectives

* Define what recursion is and how it can be used

* Understand the two essential components of a recursive function

* Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
* Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems

### What is recursion?
* A **process** (a function in our case) that calls itself

### Examples of where you have worked with recursion
* JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
* document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
* Object traversal
* We will see it with more complex data structures
* It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration

#### In almost all program languages, there is a built in data structure that manages what happens when functions are invoked

### The call stack
* It's a stack data structure
* Any time a function is invoked it is place (pushed) on the top of the call stack
* When JavaScript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will remove (pop)

### Base Case
* The condition when the recursion ends

### Misc Notes 
* JavaScript uses the call stack tool to manage function invocations
* A base case is a situation when the recursion ends

### Where things go wrong
* No base case
* Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing
* Stack overflow! (recursion that does not stop and call stack is infinitely stacked)

### Helper Method Recursion
* A pattern where you have an outer function that is not recursive which calls a recursive inner function

### Pure Recursion
* Where the function itself is self contained and it's recursive. No external data structure and no nested functions involved.

* ### Pure Recursion Tips
    * For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator, and concat that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them
    * Remember that strings are immutable so you will need to use methods like slice, substr, or substring to make copies of strings
    * To make copies of objects use Object.assign, or the spread operator
