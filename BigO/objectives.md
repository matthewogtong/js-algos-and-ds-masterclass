# Objectives

#### Motivate the need for something like Big O Notiation
* It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
* Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
* When code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications

#### Describe what Big O Notation is 
* Big O Notations is a way to formalize fuzzy counting
* It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow
* We say that an algorithm is **O(f(n))** if the number of simple operatiosn the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times **f(n)**, as **n** increases
    * f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n)
    * f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) - n<sup>2</sup>))
    * f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1)
    * f(n) could be something entirely different

#### Simpllify Big O Expressons
*

#### Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"

#### Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different alogorithms using Big O Notation
