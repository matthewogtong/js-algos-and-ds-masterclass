# Objectives

#### Motivate the need for something like Big O Notiation
* It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
* Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
* When code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications

#### Describe what Big O Notation is 

#### Simpllify Big O Expressons

#### Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"

#### Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different alogorithms using Big O Notation
